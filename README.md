Programming Assignment:

The Twitter Streaming API provides real-time access to public tweets. 
Build an application that connects to the Streaming API and processes incoming tweets to compute various statistics. 

Keep track of the following:

   - Total number of tweets received
   - Average tweets per hour/minute/second
   - Top emojis in tweets
   - Percent of tweets that contains emojis
   - Top hashtags
   - Percent of tweets that contain a url
   - Percent of tweets that contain a photo url (pic.twitter.com or instagram)
   - Top domains of urls in tweets


The emoji-data project provides a convenient emoji.json file that you can use to determine which emoji unicode characters to look for in the tweet text.
